**Exercise Summary: 3D Vector Manipulation in C#**

In this exercise, I implemented a class in C# to represent and manipulate 3D vectors. The tasks included:

- Designing a class to hold three double values (x, y, z).
- Implementing constructors and overloading mathematical operators for vector addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and more.
- Calculating dot products, cross products, and the norm (magnitude) of vectors.
- Writing methods for comparing vectors and printing their values for debugging.

To get output fx:

	mcs -target:library -out:vec.dll vec.cs
	mcs -target:exe -out:main.exe -reference:vec.dll main.cs
	mono main.exe
